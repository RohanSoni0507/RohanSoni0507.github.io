            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Rohan Soni, a 20-year-old student currently in my second year of a B.Tech program in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur Campus. My passion lies in web development, and I aspire to become a skilled full-stack developer. Here's a more in-depth look at who I am:</p>
    
            <p>My journey in the world of technology started at an early age, and I have been exploring various programming languages and frameworks to broaden my skill set. I am well-versed in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, along with utilizing technologies like Node.js and Express.js for web development. This diverse knowledge enables me to handle both front-end and back-end development tasks with ease.</p>
    
            <p>My primary area of interest lies in web development. I find joy in creating websites and applications that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and functional. This journey has been a continuous learning experience, and I am excited about the endless possibilities that the ever-evolving world of web development offers.</p>
    
            <p>I believe in the power of collaboration and am always eager to work on exciting web development projects and contribute to open-source communities. My long-term goal is to evolve into a proficient full-stack developer, capable of tackling the challenges of creating robust and dynamic web applications.</p>
